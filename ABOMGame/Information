// Welcome.
// This is the folder to hold all forms of code for the Abomination Project's game.
// The game will consist mainly of ASCII-mapped terrain with arrow key controls, reading dialogue boxes and showing pictures.
// The game will continue to improve as both my friend's and my own skill improve.
// 
// I hope you enjoy your stay.
// He is always watching.
